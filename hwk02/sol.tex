\section{Problem 1}

% If the problem has multiple parts, use \subsection command.
\subsection{True}

Using the limit method and algebra we
can see that the limit evaluates to a constant.

\begin{equation*}
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(\frac{2^{n+1}}{2^n})=
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(2^{(n+1)-(n)})=
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(2^{1})=
    2
\end{equation*}
Therefore, it must be true that $2^{n+1} = O(2^{n})$.

\subsection{False}

Using the limit method and algebra we
can see that the limit evaluates to infinity.

\begin{equation*}
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(\frac{2^{2n}}{2^n})=
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(2^{(2n)-(n)})=
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(2^{n(2-1)})=
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(2^{n})=
    \infty
\end{equation*}
Therefore, it must not be true that $2^{2n} = O(2^{n})$.

\section{Problem 2}
\begin{proof} Direct proof.
Assume for functions $f$, $g$, and $h$ that $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $g(n) = O(h(n))$.
Therefore it must be true that for constants $c$ and $d$, that $f(n) \le c * g(n)$ and $g(n) \le d * h(n)$.
Substituting in $g(n)$, you get $f(n) \le c(d*h(n))$. This is the same as $f(n) \le (c*d) h(n)$.
Because $c*d$ is a constant we have shown that $f(n) = O(h(n))$ for sufficiently large n.
\end{proof}

\section{Problem 3}
\subsection{Yes}
50\% - identify time required to read input. \newline
The time required to read in the entire array input is $\Omega{(n)}$ because you must iterate over
every item in the list once.
\newline 50\% - write conclusion. \newline
Therefore its impossible to make an algorithm that is faster than being able to see every item in the list.

\subsection{$O(n\log{n})$}
50\% - identify complexity of A and B. \newline
The complexity of A is $O(n\log{n})$ and B is $O(n)$
\newline 50\% - identify combined complexity. \newline
Using the limit definition, we can see that $n\log{n}$ is an upper bound
for $n$.
\begin{equation*}
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(\frac{n}{n\log{n}})=
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(\frac{1}{\log{n}})=
    0
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the overall complexity of $A + B$ is $O(n\log{n})$.

\subsection{$O(n^{2})$}
The two different parts are also run sequentially, so their complexities add together as well. This means the overall
complexity looks like $(n * \log{n}) + (n * n) = (n\log{n}) + (n^{2})$. This time complexity is bounded by the polynomial
which makes the overall complexity $O(n^{2})$.

\subsection{$O(a * b)$}
Starting with the inner for-loop, it is run $b$ times in all cases. Then the outer for-loop is also run
$a$ times in every case. Since they are nested for loops, the complexities multiply. Therefore the overall
complexity is $O(a * b)$.

\section{Problem 4}
\begin{proof} In order to prove $(n + a)^{d} = \Theta{(n^{d})}$
we can use the limit strategy.
\begin{equation*}
    \lim _{n\to \infty }(\frac{(n+a)^{d}}{n^d})=
    \lim _{n\to \infty }((\frac{(n+a)}{n})^d)=
    \lim _{n\to \infty }((1 + \frac{a}{n})^d)=
    \lim _{n\to \infty }((1 + 0)^d)=
    1^d
\end{equation*}
Since this limit tends to a constant, $(n + a)^{d} = \Theta{(n^{d})}$.
\end{proof}
